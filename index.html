        <p class="front">You may have already noticed that we made the decision to remove the lecture videos from our
            full-stack curriculum. Please note that this is not a decision we took lightly.Video-based coursework is a
            pretty significant process to create, and maintaining them (keeping them updated) as our curriculum improves
            and expands is proving to be quite the task for our small community of contributors.</p>
